# TVC-PROGRAMMING 

## RESEARCH: 

- Possibly Programming in C++ or Python, most likely python, what will be easiest and what is more efficient for completing the task
-   I believe using C/C++ will be the best but for the PID we might be able to use python instead or JS.
- Understand what the other teams are doing and how it involved our work 
-  Use the info collected from HALE and to create a more detailed view on this subject and create a visual plan to begin implrementing these practices.
- PID's:
    PID stands for "proportional, integral, derivative". Proportional - how off are you right now Integral - how off have you gotten in total over time
    Derivative - how are the above 2 changing
    If your rocket is currently pointing 10° away from the target vector, a P-only control loop would point the nozzle 10° in the opposite direction to correct the           course.
    If the rocket has been pointing 10° away from the target vector for 2 seconds, a PI control loop would push the nozzle in the opposite direction and keep it           pointed    there long enough to not only get you back on your original heading, but undo the unwanted motion that occured during the time it was off target.
- What other hardware do we need
  -  Arduino UNO (FOCUS on Arduino)
  -  Soldering Iron
  -  Maybe computer 

## QUESTIONS:
- What will we be programming for as in what parts do we need to work with
- What data do we need to collect
- How did they get it to move and what parts did they use



## Work:

(Plz use Visual Studio Code it is easiest to collaborate on and with Github)

Goal: Learn about what avionics is doing and what data we need to collect 
- Update: There is no avionics U+1F622
